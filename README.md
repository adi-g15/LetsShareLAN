Earlier, the plan was for a GUI. This is a CLI for now.

### PreRequisite

Install rust from [here](https://rustup.rs).

Then just clone this repo with git, and see [usage section](#usage)

```sh
cargo build
```

### Usage

1. Logging in:

By default it will fetch passwords from a MySQL database.

So first see the .env_sample file, and create corresponding .env file.

```sh
cargo run
```

1.2. Login by manually entering username,password

```sh
cargo run -- --nosql
```

2. Logout:

```sh
cargo run -- logout
```

### Idea

There is a data limit I always exhausted, while many of my friends didn't, so I can use their IDs, this is my way to automate that :)
